%\chapter{Implementation of \acro{sap} \acro{rtn}s}
%
%\label{app:rtn}
%
%Java \texttt{Fst} objects contain a boolean \texttt{isRtn} field that is
%set to true if and only if the network contains one or more references to
%subnetworks, either simple references of the form \verb!'$sub'!, which
%translate to an identity-mapping arc label \verb!$sub:$sub!, or
%crossproduct references of the form \verb!'$sub':""!, \verb!'$sub':$eps!,
%\verb!"":'$sub'! or \verb!$eps:'$sub'! which translate to an arc label
%with \verb!$sub! on one side and epsilon on the other side.  When the
%\texttt{isRtn} field is true, the Kleene \texttt{info} command outputs
%``\acro{sap} \acro{rtn}''.
%
%When operations are performed on networks, there are various semantic
%constraints that must be respected, and the code to check these
%constraints is now grouped in the file
%\texttt{OpenFstLibraryChecker.java}.  The operations that are illegal or
%restricted for \acro{rtn}s (see section~\ref{sec:saprtnrestrictions})
%detect \acro{rtn}s and throw exceptions as appropriate.
