\Kleene{} is a high-level programming language for building,
manipulating and testing weighted 
finite-state acceptors and transducers, which are collectively called
finite-state machines (\fsm{}s).
It allows programmers to define \fsm{}s using regular expressions and
right-linear phrase-structure grammars, and it provides variables,
rule-like expressions, functions and familiar
control structures.  Pre-edited \Kleene{}
scripts can be run from the command line, and a graphical user
interface is provided for interactive learning, programming and testing.

The \Kleene{} parser is implemented in JavaCC/JJTree, and the
interpreter calls functions in the OpenFst library via the Java
Native Interface (\acro{jni}).  Kleene has its own syntax, based on
familiar regular expressions, and it borrows much of its semantics from
the Xerox/\acro{parc} finite-state toolkit.

Language-restriction expression and alternation rules are implemented using
algorithms supplied by M\r{a}ns Huld\'en.
