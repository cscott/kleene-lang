The global/ directory contains the file 'predefined.kl', which contains
the basic global definitions, which become part of the Kleene language.
These global definitions go into the `global' (root) symtab Frame and
can be overridden in the `program' symtab Frame and other descendant
Frames (including stand-alone code blocks).

IT IS ALMOST ALWAYS A BAD IDEA FOR USERS TO EDIT predefined.kl

The definitions in predefined.kl become part of the Kleene language.
