	KRB 2012-04-18 notes about tools/
	external libraries that Kleene depends on.
	See Makefile


JavaCC/JJTree, needed to convert Kleene.jjt into Java code.  Currently
version 5.0.

Java .jar files

	Apache_Commons	for		commons-lang3-3.1.jar		(from tar.gz)
	dom4j					dom4j-1.6.1.jar				(from tar.gz)
	icu4j					icu4j-49_1.jar				(dist. as a .jar)
	jaxen					jaxen-1.1.1.jar				(from tar.gz)
	rome					rome-1.0.jar				(dist. as a .jar)
					Copied into Kleene/src/java/lib/

The ROME/rome library appears to be used only for
import com.sun.syndication.io.XmlReader
a reader that gets an XML file and determines the encoding.

C++ libraries, must be recompiled for each platform. See Makefile

	ICU4C			for		libicudata.49.1.1.dylib  or .so  or .dll
							libicui18n.49.1.1.dylib
							libicuuc.49.1.1.dylib
					Copied into Kleene/src/java/

	OpenFst			for		libfst.dylib			or .so or .dll
					Copied into Kleene/src/java/
