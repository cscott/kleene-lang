kleene-lang/tools/README

	Notes on the external libraries that Kleene depends on.

	For license information, see kleene-lang/NOTICE.

	You need the following information only if you are trying to compile
	Kleene from source.  You do NOT need this information if you
	are installing a pre-compiled binary.

	******

	There are currently a total of 8 external libraries to download
	and install in the proper place before you can compile Kleene from 
	source.

	The _easy_ way to get these libraries is to download
	kleene-lang-dependencies.tar.gz from the Kleene distribution
	on Dropbox (or eventually on www.kleene-lang.org).

	Unpack this "tar ball" and put the resulting
	kleene-lang-dependencies/ directory in the same directory
	as the kleene-lang/ directory (from Github).  For example,
	if your kleene-lang/ directory is in ~/projects/

	$ gunzip kleene-lang-dependencies.tar.gz
	$ tar xvf kleene-lang-dependencies.tar

	(the result is a directory named kleene-lang-dependencies)

	$ mv kleene-lang-dependencies ~/projects/

	( i.e. put kleene-lang-dependencies in the same directory
	as kleene-lang )

	$ cd ~/projects/kleene-lang/tools/
	$ make links


	For anyone trying to build Kleene from source:  
	See kleene-lang/tools/README (this file)
		kleene-lang/tools/README.updates
		and the README files for each directory under kleene-lang/tools/


The lines below are notes, not instructions.  See the README files
listed above for what you need to download and do if you are building 
Kleene from source.
