ROME

To compile Kleene from source, you need the ROME
library.

For license information, see kleene-lang/NOTICE.

For the easy way to install this library and make it
accessible to Kleene, see kleene-lang/tools/README

***** the lines below are notes, not instructions

If the easy way is not possible or appropriate, you will
need to download rome-1.0.jar
from
	http://download.java.net/maven/2/rome/rome/1.0/
to
	kleene-lang/tools/ROME/

The ROME/rome library appears to be used only for
import com.sun.syndication.io.XmlReader
a reader that gets an XML file and determines the encoding.
